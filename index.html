            <p>
                Hello, My name is Adalberto Morones, I am a current Fraud Analyst for USAA. In my current role I review cases regarding Consumer Loan applications for the bank, the reviews are done to protect the bank and the members from ID theft, Account Takeovers and Scams. I have been in this position since 12/2019. Prior to that I worked as a contractor for USAA in the same department but reviewing multiple types of fraud cases involving any type of bank product. I am currently enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp through the University of Texas to further my education in coding and get experience so I can make a change in careers.
